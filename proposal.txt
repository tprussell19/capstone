Name of Student: Thomas Russell

Name of Project: Personal Portfolio for Betsy Sauer

Project’s Purpose or Goal: Provide a place for users to see examples of Betsy’s work as a hairdresser/stylist and provide biographical and contact info

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
        - display images of her work
        - provide contact info for setting up appointments
        - provide an “about me” section to display some biographical info and qualifications

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
        - JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap?

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
        - link instagram feed through API and cycle through photos on homepage as well as dedicated images page (maybe group by style or color?)
        - allow users to check availability and make appointments through an external scheduling service (probably either vagaro or schedulicity but need to check with Betsy about paying for a service like that versus just scheduling by herself through email/texts)
        - if above doesn’t work, provide work email and/or phone number for appointment inquiries

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
        - Instagram API
        - ? external scheduling service (vagaro, schedulicity, calendly) ?

Is there anything else you’d like your instructor to know?
        - I have a friend who is a hairdresser/stylist here in Portland and she doesn’t have a personal website yet. My goal is to build one for her that won’t require a lot of maintenance/updates and can display her talents so that she can attract more clients. We will have a meeting sometime in the next week or two to go over design principles and potentially using a paid scheduling service to handle making appointments easier for her and her clients.
