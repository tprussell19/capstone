  - navbars for easy navigation throughout site
  - big, professional photos everywhere (might need more than phone pics on IG)
  - shots of salon, equipment, products, stylists
  - not a ton of shots of work on clients
  - external services for booking appointments (vagaro)
  - clean, minimalist styling (sans-serif fonts, no bullet points, lots of ALL CAPS elements outside of large blocks of text)
  - mostly white or black backgrounds
  - any awards or qualifications on splash and/or home page
