Websites for some of the top salons in Portland:
  - http://www.seventysevensalon.com/
  - https://www.alisthairstudio.com/
  - https://chachihair.com/
  - http://www.chameleonnw.com/
  - https://www.codasalon.com/

Notes:
  - most do not use React
  - most use splash pages with very little info but either big graphics or covid info with a button or navbar to click to enter full site
  - navbars for easy navigation throughout site
  - big, professional photos everywhere (might need more than phone pics on IG)
  - shots of salon, equipment, products, stylists
  - not a ton of shots of work on clients
  - external services for booking appointments (vagaro)
  - clean, minimalist styling (sans-serif fonts, no bullet points, lots of ALL CAPS elements outside of large blocks of text)
  - mostly white or black backgrounds
  - any awards or qualifications on splash and/or home page

More websites I checked out for ideas:
  - https://www.appelnouveausalon.com/
      Love the simple splash page
      minimal navbar
      static logo in top left (talk to Betsy about either personal or salon logo to use on page as stand in for "home" button on navbar)
      linking to services at the end of bios
      consistent background image at bottom of page scroll with rollover options that link to different parts
      consistent conatct/location info accross pages so you never have leave whatever page you're on to get in touch

  - https://modsalonpdx.com/
      nice big background image on home page
      defaults to scheduling an appointment
      most other info not available on the site yet. bad look (do not deploy until everything is finished and looks good!)
      styling simple but not in an artistic/good way (simple still needs to look good!)
      all pages except home shrink background image and are left looking very basic
      good example of what not to do

  - https://www.koasalon.com/
      splash page (pop-up?) asking folks to sign up for the mailing list
      lots of text boxes with semi-transparent background colors displayed over different background images (looks really busy)
      inconsistent capitalization, punctuation (drives me crazy)
      somewhere between 8-10 different fonts/styles on one page (looks like a middle school powerpoint project)
      service menu has some formatting issues but I do really like the idea of having visual examples of the types of services offered alongside the prices so that potential clients can see what they're going to be paying for

  - https://carbonsalonpdx.com/
      "Who We Are" right out front so that you get the vibe of the place
      breaks up the services page into subcategories (might not need this since Betsy just does cut/color/styling but might also be a good way to keep things clean and not make the clients have to scroll forever to see all of the options)
      external service for booking appointments
      links Instagram feed
      appears that IG feed was limited to 10 entries in a 12 square grid (make sure number of entries makes sense with layout choices)

  - http://propagandathesalon.com/
      use professional models in addition to an instagram feed of "regular" people
      header shrinks on scroll
      contact info at the bottom of each page but not in a persistent footer like some others
      every page has the header, a banner photo, and then the content for that page. It give the site a nice consistency across all of its pages while still providing some novelty with a new banner photo for each page
      simple and somewhat small photos of the stylists in black and white with just their names and no biographical info or anything more
      external scheduling tool (schedulicity)
      does provide a form for contacting the salon for "general questions and inquiries" but advises users to book through their booking page and provides a link to it
