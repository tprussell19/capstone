Things still to do:
  - longer sit-down meeting with Betsy to go over design possibilities/preferences and potential third-party scheduling service
  - solidify component diagram with feedback from meeting
  - do further research into/testing of Instagram API https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-basic-display-api/reference/user  https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-basic-display-api/reference/user/media



  Met with client 3-3:45 to go over details of project and get feedback
    keep design simple and clean
    no third party scheduling app
    will get photos, bio info, contact info, and pricing info tomorrow (monday)
